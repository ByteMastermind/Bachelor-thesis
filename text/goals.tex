\label{chap:goals}

The main goal of this thesis is to deal with a development of a portable open-source device, that will be able to clone and emulate RFID/NFC tags of various types. More precisely, the following sub-tasks are set:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Hardware and software architecture design} --- design a hardware and software architecture of an open-source device with regard to modularity and future expandability. The device must function as a stand-alone unit without the need to connect to a personal computer. To implement the device, use one of the commonly available microcomputers such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino or similar.

    \item \textbf{Software development} --- create software in C++ or Python programming language that allows cloning and emulation of RFID/NFC card/tags of at least 3 different types such as Mifare Classis, Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Desfire v1 etc. Debug the software directly in the environment of the selected microcomputer.

    \item \textbf{User interface implementation} --- implement a user interface to control the device that allows the user to easily interact with the device and use its features.

    \item \textbf{Testing} --- test the finished device on different types of RFID/NFC cards/tags and evaluate its functionality.

\end{itemize}
